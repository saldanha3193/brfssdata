# Exploring the BRFSS data

**Introduction**

The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a collaborative project between all of the states in the United States (US) and participating US territories and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). BRFSS is an ongoing surveillance system designed to measure behavioral risk factors for the non-institutionalized adult population (18 years of age and older) residing in the US. In this document, the term "state" is used to refer to all areas participating in BRFSS, including the District of Columbia, Guam, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The BRFSS objective is to collect uniform, state-specific data on preventive health practices and risk behaviors that are linked to chronic diseases, injuries, and preventable infectious diseases that affect the adult population. Factors assessed by the BRFSS in 2013 include tobacco use, HIV/AIDS knowledge and prevention, exercise, immunization, health status, healthy days - health-related quality of life, health care access, inadequate sleep, hypertension awareness, cholesterol awareness, chronic health conditions, alcohol consumption, fruits and vegetables consumption, arthritis burden, and seatbelt use. Since 2011, BRFSS conducts both landline telephone- and cellular telephone-based surveys. In conducting the BRFSS landline telephone survey, interviewers collect data from a randomly selected adult in a household. In conducting the cellular telephone version of the BRFSS questionnaire, interviewers collect data from an adult who participates by using a cellular telephone and resides in a private residence or college housing. The full BRFSS data set has been reduced to a selected group of variables, making 491775 observations of 336 variables.

I will be exploring the below chosen research question using exploratory data analysis techniques for this set of data.

**Research question 1:**

RQ1.1 Is there a relation between the general health vs the amount of sleep recorded for the adults surveyed ?

National Sleep Foundation guidelines(2015) advise that healthy adults (ages 18-64, being the major demographic of this data set) need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep per night.

As we are aware of the health benefits of good sleeping habits, namely in repair and restoration of the body leading to good health, it would be interesting to see the correlation between average sleep times and the reported heath status of the population.


**Research question 2:**

RQ2.2 Is there a relationship between life satisfaction and income levels?

Across various studies there is no sure correlation between income levels and life satisfaction as life satisfaction is different for different individuals and changes across genders as well, this is also corroborated in the research submitted by Felix Chung and Richard E.Lucas(2015).

Hence it would be interesting to find out the correlation between income levels and life satisfaction for the following brfss data set.

**Research question 3:**

RQ3.3 How does life satisfaction vary between genders based on income level?

The common notion is that women are happier than men even though they are worse off in many measurable ways, like less educated, lower incomes, worse self-reported health. This notion has been found to be misinterpreted as per the findings by Mallory Montgomery in her article dated 2016, where it was found that when the response scales for men and women was normalized, it was found that women are actually less happier than men on average. 

Hence, evaluation of the above pattern in the brfss data set would be interesting as well. It would be interesting to evaluate if on average women are less satisfied compared to men, using income levels as the scale for comparison.
